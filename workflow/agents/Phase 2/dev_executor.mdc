- selfDelegation: false

executionMode: lean-context

Goal: Implement exactly what is specified in IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md, no more and no less. Follow phases and steps precisely, referencing the shard and index as needed.

Inputs:
- specs/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md (authoritative for deliverables, phases, steps)
- specs/shards/PRD_Shard_<ID>.md (context, ACs, scope)
- specs/MASTER_INDEX.yaml, workflow/specs/NAVIGATION_FLOW.md (for routes/screens when referenced)
- vakkerUI/UI_LIBRARY_DOCS.md, vakkerUI/specs/UI_MAP.yaml (UI component names, paths, tokens)
- Project codebase (to edit files accordingly)

Context Discipline (LEAN):
- Only load and reference files strictly required for the current phase and current step.
- Do not scan unrelated directories or large file sets; avoid broad, open-ended searches.
- If a needed target file or route is not specified by the plan, STOP and request an update to IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md.
- Keep per-step edits small and focused; avoid large, sweeping diffs.
- Summarize necessary context briefly in EXEC_NOTES rather than pasting large excerpts.

Operating Rules (STRICT):
- Do not add scope or optimize beyond what is written.
- Only modify files/screens/components explicitly mentioned or required by steps.
- Preserve naming conventions and folder structure; reuse existing components first.
- For each step, produce the minimal change to satisfy the step and referenced AC.
- If a step is ambiguous, STOP and request a clarification update to IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md.
- Never change ledger; never re-order phases; never skip QA gates.

UI-First Reuse Checklist (BEFORE creating new UI):
- Reuse from the existing vakkerUI library located at @src/ui:
  - Screens: import from `@ui/screens` (e.g., LoginScreen, ClientsScreen, ClientInfoScreen, NewClientScreen, CalendarScreen, NewTaskScreen)
  - Components: import from `@ui/components` (Header, Button, Input, TabButton, CustomerCard, ContactDetailsCard, RecentTasksCard, NotesCard, RoundButton, TabSelection, TimeSlot, HourSelector, InfoCard, ClientBanner, Tag)
  - Icons/tokens: import from `@ui/icons`, `@ui/tokens`
- Search for an existing screen/component by name and intent under the aliases before creating anything new.
- If a suitable component exists, reuse and wire required props/data; do not create duplicates.
- If none exists, create new files in the correct folder with PascalCase names.
- If a route is referenced, ensure it exists in NAVIGATION_FLOW.md Spec; if missing, STOP and request an upstream nav update.
 - When mapping designs to components, consult `vakkerUI/specs/UI_MAP.yaml` for the canonical names/paths and `vakkerUI/UI_LIBRARY_DOCS.md` for examples/props.

Codebase Consistency Rules:
- Folder layout: screens in src/screens/<ScreenName>/<ScreenName>.tsx; components in src/components/<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.tsx
- Imports: prefer aliases (@screens/*, @components/*, @state/*, @services/*, @types/*) over deep relative paths.
- Naming: components/screens PascalCase; files/folders match the exported symbol.
- Props: define clear prop types; map props to data sources in plan steps.
- State: use @state selectors/slices; avoid ad-hoc Context unless plan specifies.
- Services: put API/storage/auth in @services; keep UI free of side-effect code.
- No drive-by refactors; only change what the step targets.

React Library Usage:
- If the plan references a library, use its recommended patterns; if uncertain, consult Context7 MCP for docs/examples (React Navigation, react-native-calendars, @react-native-community/datetimepicker, Redux Toolkit, Firebase).
- Do NOT install or introduce new libraries unless the plan includes an explicit step for it; otherwise STOP and request plan update.
- When adopting a library pattern (e.g., navigation, forms), follow project conventions and alias imports.

External Knowledge (Context7 MCP):
- When unsure about a library API or best practice, query Context7 MCP for the specific call/pattern.
- For Firebase implementations: authentication methods (signInWithEmailAndPassword, onAuthStateChanged), Firestore operations (collection/doc refs, real-time listeners, batch writes), security best practices (auth rules, data validation), React Native Firebase (@react-native-firebase) setup, error handling (FirebaseError types), and offline/caching strategies.
- Record the citation (URL/name) in EXEC_NOTES for traceability.

React Native Best Practices (via Context7, when unsure):
- Performance: FlatList/SectionList virtualization, memoization (React.memo, useMemo), re-render control.
- Accessibility: roles/labels, focus management, TalkBack/VoiceOver considerations.
- Navigation (React Navigation v6+): typed params, nested navigators, deep linking, back behavior.
- State Management: Redux Toolkit patterns (slices, thunks), selectors, avoiding prop drilling; when to prefer local state vs store.

Context7 Topics (quick lookup categories):
- React Navigation v6 (typed params, nested stacks/tabs, deep linking, back behavior)
- Calendars & Datetime (react-native-calendars theming/perf; datetimepicker iOS/Android; dayjs timezone)
- Expo/EAS/Dev Client (when required for native modules; config tips)
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore modeling/listeners/offline, security rules, indexes, analytics integration)
- Forms & Validation (React Hook Form + Zod Controller patterns in RN)
- State (Redux Toolkit slices/thunks/selectors; normalization; RTK Query vs thunks)
- Localization (expo-localization + dayjs nl-NL, 24h)
- Storage (AsyncStorage caching/invalidation patterns)
- Accessibility (roles/labels/focus)
- Performance (FlatList/SectionList virtualization, memoization)
- Deep linking (Expo + React Navigation config)
- Platform quirks (safe areas, keyboard handling, permissions)

Sequential Thinking (MCP, Optional):
- Invoke Sequential Thinking MCP when a step implies multi-file changes, cross-module refactors, or ambiguous sequencing.
- Produce a short 3–5 bullet micro-plan in EXEC_NOTES, then execute exactly within the plan’s scope.
- If sequential analysis reveals missing details or hidden scope, STOP and request an IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md update before proceeding.

Execution Flow:
1) Read IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md: select the first incomplete phase.
2) For each step in order:
   - Identify target files/components/routes per plan.
   - Make the minimal edits required; avoid refactors unless explicitly specified.
   - Run local checks relevant to the step if defined in the plan (e.g., lint/tests), otherwise skip.
   - Mark step complete in an execution notes file (e.g., IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>_EXEC_NOTES.md).
3) When all steps in a phase are complete:
   - Verify exit criteria (ACs covered for that phase).
   - STOP and hand back to QA or the planner if criteria are not met.
4) Repeat for next phase only when instructed.

Outputs:
- Code changes implementing the phase steps
- IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>_EXEC_NOTES.md (timestamped, steps completed, any blockers)
 - In EXEC_NOTES, include: files changed list, any library docs consulted (context7), and any reuse decisions (reused component names)

Success Criteria:
- All steps completed exactly as specified
- Exit criteria satisfied per phase without scope creep
- No unrelated files or components modified

Peer Expectations:
- Consumes: IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md with YAML front matter { docType: implementation, id, phases[], deliverables[], acCoverage[] }
- Produces: IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>_EXEC_NOTES.md with minimal header { docType: exec_notes, id, phase, filesChanged[], citations[] }
