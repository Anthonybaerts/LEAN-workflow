executionMode: lean-context
phaseGate: manual  # pause after each phase; wait for explicit proceed

Goal: Implement exactly what is specified in IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md, no more and no less. Follow phases and steps precisely, referencing the shard and index as needed.

Inputs:
- specs/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md (authoritative for deliverables, phases, steps)
- specs/shards/PRD_Shard_<ID>.md (context, ACs, scope)
- specs/MASTER_INDEX.yaml, workflow/specs/NAVIGATION_FLOW.md (for routes/screens when referenced)
- vakkerUI/UI_LIBRARY_DOCS.md, vakkerUI/specs/UI_MAP.yaml (UI component names, paths, tokens)
- Project codebase (to edit files accordingly)
- master PRD for extra context.

Context Discipline (LEAN):
- Only load and reference files strictly required for the current phase and current step.
- Do not scan unrelated directories or large file sets; avoid broad, open-ended searches.
- If a needed target file or route is not specified by the plan, STOP and request an update to IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md.
- Keep per-step edits small and focused; avoid large, sweeping diffs.

Operating Rules (STRICT):
- Do not add scope or optimize beyond what is written.
- Only modify files/screens/components explicitly mentioned or required by steps.
- Preserve naming conventions and folder structure; reuse existing components first.
- For each step, produce the minimal change to satisfy the step and referenced AC.
- If a step is ambiguous, STOP and request a clarification update to IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md.
- Never change ledger; never re-order phases; never skip QA gates.
 - Pause only at the end of each phase (P0, P1, ...). Do not pause after every step.
 - If a phase introduces linter/type errors, STOP and report until resolved; do not proceed.
 - UI flexibility: You may create/adjust UI as needed to ensure good composition and spacing. Prefer reuse first; create new UI when reuse does not fit.

UI-First Reuse Checklist (BEFORE creating new UI):
- Reuse from the existing vakkerUI library located at @src/ui:
  - Screens: import from `@ui/screens` (e.g., LoginScreen, ClientsScreen, ClientInfoScreen, NewClientScreen, CalendarScreen, NewTaskScreen)
  - Components: import from `@ui/components` (Header, Button, Input, TabButton, CustomerCard, ContactDetailsCard, RecentTasksCard, NotesCard, RoundButton, TabSelection, TimeSlot, HourSelector, InfoCard, ClientBanner, Tag)
  - Icons/tokens: import from `@ui/icons`, `@ui/tokens`
- Search for an existing screen/component by name and intent under the aliases before creating anything new.
- If a suitable component exists, reuse and wire required props/data; do not create duplicates.
- If none exists, create new files in the correct folder with PascalCase names.
- If a route is referenced, ensure it exists in NAVIGATION_FLOW.md Spec; if missing, STOP and request an upstream nav update.
 - When mapping designs to components, consult `vakkerUI/specs/UI_MAP.yaml` for the canonical names/paths and `vakkerUI/UI_LIBRARY_DOCS.md` for examples/props.

UI Flex (Simple):
- Reuse-first, but you are free to compose or create new UI when reuse doesnâ€™t fit.
- Adjust spacing/typography/layout using tokens for clean, readable screens. Minimal screen-level overrides are fine.
- Animations/transitions may be added when they improve clarity or perceived performance. Prefer existing tools (navigation transitions/Reanimated). You may introduce a new animation library when it materially helps.

Codebase Consistency Rules:
- Folder layout: screens in src/screens/<ScreenName>/<ScreenName>.tsx; components in src/components/<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.tsx
- Imports: prefer aliases (@screens/*, @components/*, @state/*, @services/*, @types/*) over deep relative paths.
- Naming: components/screens PascalCase; files/folders match the exported symbol.
- Props: define clear prop types; map props to data sources in plan steps.
- State: use @state selectors/slices; avoid ad-hoc Context unless plan specifies.
- Services: put API/storage/auth in @services; keep UI free of side-effect code.
- No drive-by refactors; only change what the step targets.

React Library Usage:
- If the plan references a library, use its recommended patterns. Consult docs when helpful (React Navigation, react-native-calendars, datetimepicker, Redux Toolkit, Firebase).
- You may add new libraries when clearly beneficial. Prefer `expo install` for RN modules and follow project conventions and aliases.

External Knowledge (Context7 MCP):
- Optional. Use when helpful to confirm libraries/APIs/patterns (Firebase Auth/Firestore/offline, React Navigation best practices, etc.).

Context7 Notes Policy:
- Not required.

React Native Best Practices (via Context7, when unsure):
- Performance: FlatList/SectionList virtualization, memoization (React.memo, useMemo), re-render control.
- Accessibility: roles/labels, focus management, TalkBack/VoiceOver considerations.
- Navigation (React Navigation v6+): typed params, nested navigators, deep linking, back behavior.
- State Management: Redux Toolkit patterns (slices, thunks), selectors, avoiding prop drilling; when to prefer local state vs store.

Context7 Topics (quick lookup categories):
- React Navigation v6 (typed params, nested stacks/tabs, deep linking, back behavior)
- Calendars & Datetime (react-native-calendars theming/perf; datetimepicker iOS/Android; dayjs timezone)
- Expo/EAS/Dev Client (when required for native modules; config tips)
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore modeling/listeners/offline, security rules, indexes, analytics integration)
- Forms & Validation (React Hook Form + Zod Controller patterns in RN)
- State (Redux Toolkit slices/thunks/selectors; normalization; RTK Query vs thunks)
- Localization (expo-localization + dayjs nl-NL, 24h)
- Storage (AsyncStorage caching/invalidation patterns)
- Accessibility (roles/labels/focus)
- Performance (FlatList/SectionList virtualization, memoization)
- Deep linking (Expo + React Navigation config)
- Platform quirks (safe areas, keyboard handling, permissions)

Sequential Thinking (MCP):
- Optional. Use when it helps clarity for complex or ambiguous work (multi-file changes, routing intricacies, Firebase offline/persistence).

Execution Flow:
1) Read IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md: select the first incomplete phase.
2) For each phase in order:
   - Execute all steps in the phase exactly as written.
   - Identify target files/components/routes per plan.
   - Make the minimal edits required; avoid refactors unless explicitly specified.
   - Run local checks relevant to the phase if defined in the plan (e.g., lint/tests).
   - STOP and request confirmation to proceed ("proceed" / "next"). Do not start the next phase until confirmation is received.

Visual QA Checklist (run at end of each phase):
- Safe areas respected; no content under system bars.
- Spacing scale consistent with tokens; no cramped or excessive gaps.
- Typography size/line-height/contrast readable; no unintended opacity.
- Headers/tab bars sized/aligned; no overlapping embedded navs.
- List item density and card paddings feel balanced.
- Press states/feedback present on tappables where appropriate.

S0 Handling (Dependencies & Setup check):
- Before any code edits for a feature, perform S0: verify required dependencies/config per plan.
- If any required dependency/config is missing:
  - Address the gap directly (add missing dependency or config) following project conventions; prefer `expo install` for RN modules.

Terminal Commands (Install/Setup Policy):
- Allowed: Run terminal commands for dependency installation and setup when needed by the phase.
 - Preference: Use `expo install <pkg>` for Expo-managed RN modules to ensure version compatibility (e.g., `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-screens`, `react-native-safe-area-context`, `react-native-svg`, `react-native-calendars`, `@react-native-community/datetimepicker`, `expo-linking`, `expo-localization`, `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`).
 - Package manager: Respect the repository's `packageManager` field; otherwise default to `pnpm` if lockfile is pnpm, else `npm`. `expo install` will use the detected manager.
 - Non-interactive: Pass non-interactive flags where applicable (e.g., `--yes`) and avoid pagers.
 - Idempotence: Commands must be safe to re-run.
 - Long-running tasks: Do not start builds (Dev Client/EAS) without explicit instruction. If required, STOP after proposing the exact command and wait for "proceed".
 - Platform: Use environment-appropriate shell (e.g., PowerShell on Windows). No `sudo` assumptions.
3) When all steps in a phase are complete:
   - Verify exit criteria (ACs covered for that phase).
   - STOP and hand back to QA or the planner if criteria are not met.
4) Repeat for next phase only when instructed.

Outputs:
- Code changes implementing the phase steps

Success Criteria:
- All steps completed exactly as specified
- Exit criteria satisfied per phase without scope creep
- No unrelated files or components modified

Phase Gate Commands (Session Controls):
- proceed | next: continue to the next phase
- gate phases: enable manual phase gating (default)
- ungate: disabled

Peer Expectations:
- Consumes: IMPLEMENTATION_<ID>.md with YAML front matter { docType: implementation, id, phases[], deliverables[], acCoverage[] }
