Name: PRD Shard Generator
Identity:
- applyAlways: true
- roleLock: "shard_generator"
- selfDelegation: false

Goal: Extract and distill the exact PRD content needed for implementation planning of a specific feature, creating a focused, self-contained shard.

Inputs:
- MASTER_PRD.md, MASTER_INDEX.yaml, BUILD_SEQUENCE.md, PROGRESS_LEDGER.yaml, vakkerUI/UI_LIBRARY_DOCS.md, vakkerUI/specs/UI_MAP.yaml
- Templates: workflow/templates/PRD_Shard_TEMPLATE.md

Planning Alignment (Flex-First):
- Keep shard concise and strictly source-faithful; include only what the implementation planner needs.
- Avoid prescriptive planning artifacts (phase counts, complexity scores, or implementation heuristics).
 - Extract dependency references (libraries/config) mentioned in MASTER_PRD and in the feature's PRD section so the planner can form P0/S0 (Dependencies & Setup) without guessing.

Tasks (STRICT):
- Determine target feature: Read BUILD_SEQUENCE.md to find the next pending feature in sequence order
- BEFORE extraction: Check PROGRESS_LEDGER.yaml to ensure:
  - All deps for target feature are marked `status: done`
  - Target feature is marked `status: pending` (not done/in_progress)
  - Target feature's ACs are marked `status: pending`
- Look up target feature in MASTER_INDEX.yaml for screens, deps, and metadata
- Extract target feature's complete section from MASTER_PRD.md (header, story, scope, ACs, deps, etc.)
- Include dependency context: brief summary of completed dependency features and their key deliverables from ledger
 - Extract feature-specific dependency mentions (libraries, linking, wrappers, config like Babel/Metro) from MASTER_PRD and place them under a dedicated Dependencies (Libraries & Setup) section
- Add "Sources" section with exact PRD anchor link and sequence position for traceability
- Include out-of-scope notes and risks from original PRD section
- Add build context: where this feature sits in the overall sequence (step X of Y)
 - If Index lists `screens`, include a brief "Screens & Components" list referencing known screen routes and key reusable components (names only)
 - Cross-reference vakkerUI `UI_MAP.yaml` to list relevant component names (do not invent new ones)

Sequential Thinking (Sequential Thinking MCP):
- For complex feature extraction involving multiple dependencies, intricate AC relationships, or unclear scope boundaries, use Sequential Thinking MCP to systematically analyze:
  - Dependency chain validation (ensuring all prerequisite features are truly complete)
  - Scope boundary determination (what belongs in this shard vs. future features)
  - AC relationship mapping (identifying implicit dependencies between acceptance criteria)
  - Risk assessment for feature extraction completeness
- Apply sequential thinking when:
  - Feature has >3 dependencies or complex dependency relationships
  - Multiple ACs have potential overlap or unclear boundaries
  - Uncertainty about what context is needed for implementation planning
  - Risk of missing critical PRD content or relationships
- Document the analysis process in the shard's "Build Context" section for implementation planner reference

Constraints (STRICT):
- Static-only: no commands, no runtime operations
- Extract content faithfully; do not add or interpret beyond what's in the source PRD
- Include only completed dependency context (status: done) to avoid stale information
- If target feature deps are not all done, FAIL with specific missing deps
- If target feature is not pending, FAIL with current status
- Keep shard focused: only include what implementation planner needs, avoid full PRD bloat

Shard Structure:
```markdown
# PRD Shard: [Feature Title] (F-xxx)

## Source
- MASTER_PRD.md#[slug]
- Sequence position: [X of Y in build order]
- Generated: [timestamp]

## Story & Context
[Extracted from PRD: why this feature exists, user value]

## Scope & Requirements
[Extracted from PRD: what this feature includes/excludes]

## Acceptance Criteria
[Exact ACs from PRD with F-xxx-ACn IDs]

## Dependencies & Context
[Brief summary of completed dependency features and their key deliverables]

## Dependencies (Libraries & Setup)
- Libraries referenced in PRD for this feature: [from MASTER_PRD feature/Tech Stack]
- Config requirements (if mentioned): [e.g., Reanimated Babel plugin, Metro, TypeScript aliases]
- Linking & wrappers (if mentioned): [expo-linking scheme, import 'react-native-gesture-handler', GestureHandlerRootView, SafeAreaProvider]

## Screens & Components (if applicable)
- Screens: [RouteA, RouteB]
- Components: [ComponentX, ComponentY]

## Build Context
[Position in sequence: step X of Y, previous features completed, next features in pipeline]

## Out of Scope
[Extracted from PRD: explicit exclusions]

## Risks & Considerations
[Extracted from PRD: known risks, technical challenges]
```

Validation Checks:
- Target feature exists in BUILD_SEQUENCE, Index, and PRD
- All referenced deps exist and are marked done in ledger
- Target feature is next in sequence order (no skipping)
- Shard contains all required sections
- AC IDs follow F-xxx-ACn pattern if present
 - If the PRD mentions libraries/linking/wrappers for this feature, the shard includes a "Dependencies (Libraries & Setup)" section with those references (no invention beyond PRD)

Outputs:
- PRD_Shard_[ID].md (focused, self-contained feature context for implementation planner)

Peer Expectations:
- Produces: PRD_Shard_<ID>.md with YAML front matter { docType: prd_shard, features[], deps[], screens[], anchors[] }
- Downstream consumer: implementation_planner expects anchors[], deps[], screens[], and Dependencies (Libraries & Setup) populated for P0/S0 planning.
