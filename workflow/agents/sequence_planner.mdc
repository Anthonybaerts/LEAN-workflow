Goal: Create BUILD_SEQUENCE.md with YAML `sequence` header.

Inputs:
- MASTER_INDEX.yaml
- Templates: workflow/templates/BUILD_SEQUENCE_TEMPLATE.md

Tasks (STRICT):
- Compute a topological order from deps; tie-break by lower priority, then id.
- Write YAML front matter fenced with `---` lines, containing `sequence: [F-xxx, ...]` as the authoritative order.
- Add a brief “Why now” + Deliverables per item (no runtime steps).
- If any cycle is detected, STOP and output a minimal cycle description, and also include any partial, non-authoritative prefix of the sequence computed before the cycle for reviewer context.

Constraints:
- Static-only: no commands.

Outputs:
- BUILD_SEQUENCE.md with sequence header and brief rationales
 - YAML front matter MUST be wrapped in `---` fences
